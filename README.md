# Combining Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to Identify Stress from Mental Health Conditions in Subreddit Posts

## Abstract
Accurately diagnosing mental illness poses unique challenges relative to other chronic diseases. While objective tests exist for many medical conditions, mental health diagnoses rely heavily on qualitative observations. Moreover, factors such as systematic and structural challenges, healthcare provider variabilities, communication complexities, and patient factors further enhance diagnostic challenges. This study addresses the need for more objective means of examining the application of NLP in processing mental health-related data. Utilizing a dataset of subreddit posts, we employed NLP and machine learning techniques to detect linguistic markers of stress and mental health conditions. The study compared the efficacy of various word embedding methods—ELMo, BERT, and Bag of Words (BoW)—alongside three different machine learning models—Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost—to classify text data. Our results indicate that BERT embeddings, particularly when used with Logistic Regression and SVM, significantly enhance the identification of stress indicators, potentially offering a more objective lens through which mental health can be assessed. This work suggests a promising direction for augmenting traditional diagnostic methods with automated text analysis tools, aiming to reduce subjectivity in mental health diagnoses and support healthcare professionals in their clinical assessments.
